## Objectives:
- Multiple quests to complete across the map.

## Cheat:
- Towards bottom of the map, next to the snow mountain hill in the little crevice, the player can press A all the way against the wall and activate gruelsome mode.
- Gruelsome mode converts all the villages to be hostile to the player, an the player can basically go murder everyone in the towns for money. 
- The game is still able to be won in the dungeon, but the player is super charged so the game becomes ridiculously easy.
